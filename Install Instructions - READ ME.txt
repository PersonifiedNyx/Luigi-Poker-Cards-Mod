INSTALLION INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------

1.) Download Winrar or 7zip.

2.) Go to where you have the balatro exe installed, right click on Balatro.exe, select open archive. (*Note: For Steam users its gonna be under -> [insert drive here]:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Balatro)
    
3.) Once you open the Balatro.exe archive, open the resources folder. Before you do anything else, MAKE SURE TO BACKUP THE ORIGINAL "Enhancers.png" FILES IN BOTH THE 1X AND 2X FOLDER. 

Once you backup the original "Enhancers.png" files and stored them somewhere safe, feel free to then replace the ones in the archive with the "Enhancers.png" files from my mod. 

(*Note: Creating backups is important because if you ever wanna stop using my mods' enhancers you NEED the OG (original) files.)

...And that's it your all done! In the near future I'll work on making this compatible/usable with Malverk so it's easier to install and manage ^^
