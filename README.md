The Luigi Poker Cards Mod
------------------------------------------------------------------
Heyo I'm Nyx and thanks for checking out my Luigi's Poker theme Balatro mod!
This mod replaces the standard card graphics with those from the Luigi Poker mini-game within NSMB DS.
I'm looking to keep the mod as close to the mini-game as possible while still keeping some classic Balatro elements.
Outside of scaling the sprites/assets everything is pretty much untouched, except the numbers which did have to be cleaned up a little by me.

The mod so far comes with 2 different palette/variations, each with a low contrast and high contrast option.
The Single-Sprite version is closer to being 1:1 with the original mini-game cards.
Multi-Sprite version is more visually aligned with Balatro's original cards.

Future Plans :>
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since this is my first ever mod, this version is pretty simple and barebones at the moment.
Overtime as I (hopefully) get better with coding and stuff I would like to improve/grow this mod to the best of my ability.
Some ideas I have may require a separate mod to be made but I'll upload the files here as add-ons, and provide further instructions if needed :>

100% looking to implement:
- Make the card backgrounds 1:1 with the mini-game.
- Make the backs of the different decks the same style as in the mini-game.

Potential Ideas:
- Custom textures for seals
- Custom Jokers (I'll provide an example in the images tab and see if y'all are interested) 
- Custom textures for Tarots, Planets, Spectral Cards, etc
- Add more color palettes for the suites. I'd be willing to take suggestions ^^
