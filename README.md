 The Luigi Poker Cards Mod
------------------------------------------------------------------
Heyo I'm Nyx and thanks for checking out my Luigi's Poker theme Balatro mod!
This mod replaces the standard card graphics with those from the Luigi Poker mini-game within NSMB DS.
I'm looking to keep the mod as close to the mini-game as possible while still keeping some classic Balatro elements.
Outside of scaling the sprites/assets everything is pretty much untouched, except the numbers which did have to be cleaned up a little by me.

The mod so far comes with 2 different palette/variations, each with a low contrast and high contrast option.
The Single-Sprite version is closer to being 1:1 with the original mini-game cards.
Multi-Sprite version is more visually aligned with how Balatro's original cards.

Future Plans :>
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since this is my first ever mod, this version is pretty simple and barebones at the moment ^^'
Overtime as I (hopefully) get better with coding and stuff I would like to improve/grow this mod to the best of my ability.
Some ideas I have may require a separate mod to be made but I'll upload the files here as add-ons, and provide further instructions if needed :>

100% looking to implement:
1.) Make the card backgrounds 1:1 with the mini-game.
2.) Make the backs of the different decks the same style as in the mini-game.

Undecided (50/50 chance to implement):
1.) Custom textures for seals
2.) Custom Jokers (I'll provide an example in the images tab and see if y'all are interested) 
3.) Custom textures for Tarots, Planets, Spectral Cards, etc
4.) Add more color palettes for the suites. I'd be willing to take suggestions ^^
 
 Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.) This mod requires Steamodded and Lovely.
2.) Download the LuigiPokerCards.zip
